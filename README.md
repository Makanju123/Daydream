### Game Modes

#### Survival

The objective is to be the last player standing. Each player starts with a set number of lives, and loses a life when the opponent scores. When you lose a life, you may have to make a sacrifice. The game ends when one player runs out of lives.

#### Scores

The goal is to score as many points as possible before the time runs out. The player with the highest score at the end of the match wins.

### Settings

Before each match, you can customize the following settings:

*   **Difficulty:** Adjust the CPU's skill level.
*   **Game Mode:** Choose between Survival and Scores.
*   **Lives/Duration:** Set the number of lives for Survival mode or the match duration for Scores mode.
*   **Multi-Ball:** Enable or disable multi-ball mode.
*   **Theme:** Select your preferred arena theme.
